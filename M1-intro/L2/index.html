  <h1>Learn How to Ask a Question</h1>
  <h2>A surprisingly challenging task</h2>
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>One of the most critical tools you will <i>ever</i> develop as a human being is the ability to formulate a question about a problem you're having. Many people incorrectly assume that the  most valuable piece of information to a question is its answer. Even more valuable in the long-term is the path taken to find the answer. If you can figure out that path, you not only solve your current problem,you also guarantee a better outcome for any problems you will encounter in the future</p>

    <p>When learning programming, formulating a question about your problem is especially helpful due to the massive amount of software knowledge, advice, forums, tutorials, and repositories indexed online. This is not true for every question, of course, but you can get pretty far on your own with a few well-placed search terms.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, we're going to discuss two aspects of asking a question:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>How to properly Google a problem</li>
      <li>Once you've exhausted that option, how to formulate your question to someone else</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Google</h2>
    <p>A lot of people just starting in programming don't fully recognize how much Googling even the most senior developers do <i>every day</i> in their jobs. No one can remember everything, particularly with the rapid pace of development. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65918/importance-of-learning-to-google-efficiently-for-a-programmer" target="_blank">As one commenter on Stackoverflow said:</a></p>

    <blockquote>I would rather be more knowledgeable at searching in general than knowledgeable about what I am searching for. If I am more efficient at searching, I can find anything. If I am more knowledgeable about a single subject, I am only good at searching within that subject.</blockquote>

    <p>This cannot be emphasized enough. Senior engineers often use search engines to find answers to their software questions. If senior devs do it, why wouldn't you?</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for using Google effectively to find an answer to your problem. We'll then walk through an example.</p>

    <h3>Google Search Tricks</h3>

    <p>Searching is so important that Google has developed their own search bar syntax you can leverage to get better results. There are some good resources out there. Here are a few:</p>

    <h4>Quotes</h4>
    <p>Putting search terms in quotes (<code>"like this"</code> instead of <code>like this</code>) tells Google to only return results with that exact phrase in it. This is extremely helpful if you have a good error message with some noticeable keywords. If you're not getting good results without quotes, try it with quotes to narrow the scope. 
      
    <p>Use this feature somewhat selectively, though. The more specific your search, the fewer results you'll get!</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-quotes.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <h4><code>site:</code></h4>

    <p>You can harness the algorithmic power of Google to execute a search within a single domain. This is best used if the website does not have a good internal search engine or there are multiple subdomains within a specific site.</p>
    
    <p>An example of a poor internal search engine is the New York Times. To effectively search the New York Times website, you can simply Google:</p>

    <code>site:NYTimes.com SEARCH TERMS HERE</code>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-site-nyt.png" alt="screenshot of google search using site: search parameter">
    </div>

    <p>An example of wanting to search a site with multiple subdomains is <a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit.</a> Let's say you want to get a nice collection of cute animal memes but you're not sure which <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/subreddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> to search. You can use the <code>site:</code> term to Google:</p>

    <code>site:reddit.com SEARCH TERMS HERE</code>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-site-reddit.png" alt="screenshot of google search using site: search parameter">
    </div>

    <p>Please note that you do <b>not</b> put a space between <code>site:</code> and the domain. <code>site:reddit.com</code> will work but <code>site: reddit.com</code> will not! </p>

    <h4>Search Operators: <code>* | - before: after:</code></h4>

    <p>Google also recognizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">operators,</a> symbols common to programming languages.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.googleguide.com/wildcard_operator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asterisk <code>*</code></a> functions as a "wildcard" operator. This is useful for when you can't remember an entire phrase or a specific word. Subsitute what you can't remember in a phrase with the <code>*</code>.</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-wildcard.png" alt="screenshot of google search using wildcard search operator">
    </div>

    <p>The <code>OR</code> operator, also known as the pipe <code>|</code>, asks Google to return searchs related to at least one of the search terms. It's similar to combining two separate searches: <code>(python OR blockchain) free course</code></p>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-or.png" alt="screenshot of google search using OR operator">
    </div>

    <p>The minus operator <code>-</code> can be used to <i>exclude</i> a term from your search results. Let's say you want to know about a certain term but no Wikipedia results, you could search for something like:</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-minus-1.png" alt="screenshot of google search without minus operator">
    </div>
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-minus-2.png" alt="screenshot of google search with minus operator">
    </div>

    <p>The range operators <code>before:</code> and <code>after:</code> allow you to search within a date range. To search for financial tutorials from a certain date range, you can search <code>financial tutorials after:2010 before:2015</code>. </p>

    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../../img/google-search-range.png" alt="screenshot of google search with range operator">
    </div>

    </ul>

    <p>Now that you've learned some basic search techniques, let's walk through the thought process when trying to solve a programming error message on our own.</p>

    <h3>The error message is your friend</h3>
    <p>When you hit a snag, almost always you'll get an error message. The error message is your ticket to success. Sometimes you can get an answer just pasting an error message into a search engine.</p>
    
    <p>Most likely, you'll have to alter it a little bit. Take the error message below, which we get while using an Ethereum software tool called <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/" target="_blank">Truffle:</a></p>

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-1.png" alt="A command line displaying an error from the Ethereum framework Truffle" srcset=""></div>

    <p>This error has occurred because there is no port specified in the configuration file (don't worry if none of those words make sense). We don't know that yet, all we know is we have an error message.</p>

    <p>The first line of error says: <code>Something went wrong while attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</code> First, we want to remove generic terms. This will help narrow the search. Let's remove <code>Something went wrong while</code> which leaves us with <code>attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</code> Let's stick with the last sentence <code>Check your network configuration</code>, as it's something we're being asked to check. You could also put this error message in quotes for Google so we get an exact match. However, this is probably not necessary for our first search. (If the first search still didn't give us good results, we could try again with quotes.)</p>

    <p>Second, we're going to want to add to our search whatever piece of software or library we're using, to further narrow down our problem. So our search is <code>Truffle check your network configuration</code>.</p> Here's my results page:

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-2.png" alt="First page of search results for 'truffle check your network configuration'"></div>

    <p>The first site looks promising, as its Truffle softwares <i>documentation page.</i> A project's documentation page contains any and all known aspects of the project. When we click on that link, we get:</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-3.png" alt="Truffle configuration page with the answer to our problem circled in red"></div>

    <p>Circled in red is an example of a perfect network configuration. If we check it against our misbehaving code, we will find our error.</p>

    <p>Note: all major browsers have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools" target="_blank">developer tools,</a> which include a console for error messages. If you're working on a website, that's a great place to find errors.</p>

    <p>This process is not necessarily intuitive and may take some time to learn. But after a while, you will develop a sense of the best words to use to search to get the best results. You'll also start to recognize websites that seem well-structured and informative.</p>

    <p>Most despairingly, typically solving one problem will lead to another problem surfacing. Take a deep breath and repeat the process on <i>that</i> problem. But be sure to remember the issues as they arise. The knowledge you gain from solving one problem on a project stands to benefit any future problems.</p>


    <h4>A Note About Stack Overflow</h4>

    <p>The generous and benevolent gods of the internet have given software developers a great gift. That is the elitist, snarky but nonetheless extremely smart community on the website Stack Overflow (sometimes abbreviated SO).</p>

    <p>A lot of journeys of software troubleshooting will end at Stack Overflow, but sometimes it might even be helpful to start your search within Stack Overflow itself using the <code>site:stackoverflow.com</code> parameter. Regardless, you will become very familiar with this site. (Note that it can be difficult for new users to ask or answer a question on the site, but a lot of historical posts are still helpful.) </p>


    <h1>How to Ask Someone For Help</h1>

    <p>At times, all the searching in the world doesn't get you the answers you need. Sometimes you're not getting the expected behavior from your computer, but there are no error messages, just your frustrated face. At that point, you need to ask someone for help. We'll show you the best way to do that in the context of programming.</p>

    <p>The first thing to know about how to ask someone for help is <i>when</i> to ask someone for help. If you're totally lost, absolutely reach out for help. However, you should take some time and basic effort of deducing the problem on your own before coming to someone else for help. We do this for two reasons: First, you want to be respectful of people's time. You should follow the steps above to search around on the internet, then you can let the person know what you've found. Second, if you haven't done the basic Googling, that's exactly what the person you're reaching out to is going to do. Many people believe mentors or instructors wouldn't stoop to use a search engine but, spoiler alert, it's one of the most powerful tools. So rather than feeling dependent on someone else to do something well within your capacity, you should empower yourself to do the basic sleuthing first.</p>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>This cannot be stressed enough: <b>Context is an absolute, ultimate, don't-even-ask-unless-you-have-it requirement for asking a question.</b> Since we are all virtual, no one can see your setup or be able to look at your computer themselves. As a result, we don't know what led you to have your problem. Also, people in different timezones might have an answer but won't be able to ask if you're already offline.</p>
    
    <p>Since context is so important, we've provided a template that you <b>MUST</b> use when you are asking a question in the course. Seriously, we're going to make you fill this out if you don't use this template! We'll explain why after we go through it.</p>

    <h5>Template for Questions</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>My question is: 
        <ul>
          <li>Related to something technical I'm struggling with</li>
          <li>A concept I don't understand</li>
          <li>A question about logistics in the course (quizzes, grading, final project submission)</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <p>For technical questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is your computer environment:
            <ul>
              <li>What OS version are you running? (Name and release version, i.e. MacOS Big Sur, Ubuntu 20.04)</li>
              <li>If you're asking a question about a specific piece of software or library, what version are you running? Typically, in desktop software, this is found in the "File > About" dropdown menu or, for command line software, by running <code>[PROGRAM-NAME] --version</code> or <code>[PROGRAM-NAME] -v</code></li>
              <li>If you're using npm, what version are you running? use <code>npm -v</code> to find out.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What is your issue:
            <ul>
              <li>Describe your problem in general terms.</li>
              <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
              <li>What actually happened? Please give examples and provide screenshots of the error. Please copy the error message and provide it when asking the question. </li>
              <li>Please provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Steps already taken:
            <ul>
              <li>What have you tried already?</li>
              <li>Any promising Google or Stack Overflow results?</li>
              <li>What do you think the problem might be?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>For questions about concepts you don't understand:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the concept you have a question about? Is it in the course, if so, which module or lesson?</li>
          <li>What about this concept <b>do</b> you understand? Are there concepts related to it that you do understand?</li>
          <li>What about this concept <b>don't</b> you understand?</li>
          <li>Using specific keywords, have you searched online or in the Discord chat?</li>
          <li>Please link to any relevant documents. If you're asking about something not in the course, please provide a link related to the concept.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>For questions about logistics in the course:</p>  
        <ul>
          <li>What module / lesson are you having trouble with?</li>
          <li>Describe your problem in general terms.</li>
          <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
          <li>What actually happened?</li>
          <li>What have you tried already?</li>
          <li>What do you think the problem might be?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>While it may seem burdensome to fill out this template, it ensures two things. First, it helps you understand the nature of the problem you're asking about. Sometimes doing that can help us solve our own problems. Second, it provides the valuable context we mentioned above. This increases our chances of finding an answer as it reduces the amount of time and effort needed to understand the basics of the situation. And it provides an asynchronous way of someone else understanding your problem so they can still try to help even if you're not online.</p>
